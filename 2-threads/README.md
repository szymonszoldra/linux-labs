## PROJECT 2

Write a 2-threaded program. The main thread randomly generates array elements, e.g. int
arr[2][10]. Thread 1 counts the sum of the elements of the first row of the array. Thread 2 counts the sum of the items
the second line of the array. The main story counts the total sum of the subtotals determined by
individual threads.
